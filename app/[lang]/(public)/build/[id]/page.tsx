            In this project we were given a unique opportunity to propose a
            challenging design that should be scalable, replicable, sustainable
            and reversible.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having a minimal foot print, impact on the site and vegetation
            should be reduced to a minimum. And to provide an exceptional
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            At 3000m altitude, the top of Jebel Sawda is one of the highest
            locations in Saudi Arabia.
            <br />
            <br />
            The western side of the mountain has retained most of its natural
            roughed terrain and vegetation, has extensive views, humid weather
            and low temperatures during most of the year.

            First. Locations, on the edge of the mountain cliff that will be
            accessible by a walkway.
            <br />
            <br />
            Second. In order to achieve a more delicate presence on the
            landscape the shelterâ€™s footprint is split into units that are then
            merged into a single more complex geometry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Third. Reproduction and variation. Various prototypes where designed
            to allow different combinations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fourth. Positioning. The V shape of the cabin will open up towards
            the view whilst allowing a reducing its physical shape on the rear
            side, giving the impression of a much smaller structure than it
            actually is.
